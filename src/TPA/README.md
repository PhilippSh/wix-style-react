# Wix Style React TPA

Here you will find components with default styling taken from the metasite's style params. In addition these styles can be overridden the TPA developer.

## How it works

Each component comes with a style sheet that is injected into the DOM with a wix-style attribute. The style sheet is added to the top of the head to allow your own styles to override default styles.
